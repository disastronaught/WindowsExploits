When we're looking on the local machine for things that run on a daily/hourly basis which the machine uses
to update or maintain itself, we need to first look at a similar setup. Preferrable a Windows machine with
a reasonably modern OS, and then we'll look into the TaskScheduler. Now, we could pour over the TaskManager
and manually review running processes for registry addresses to point cobalt strike beacons toward, but its
faster to use powershell and the following script to identify processes which boot on login.

$Tasks = Get-ScheduledTask

foreach ($Task in $Tasks)
{
  if ($Task.Actions.ClassId -ne $null)
  {
    if ($Task.Triggers.Enabled -eq $true)
    {
      if ($Task.Principal.GroupId -eq "Users")
      {
        Write-Host "Task Name: " $Task.TaskName
        Write-Host "Task Path: " $Task.TaskPath
        Write-Host "CLSID: " $Task.Actions.ClassId
        Write-Host
      }
    }
  }
}
